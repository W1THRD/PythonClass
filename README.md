# PythonClass
Projects I made when I took the classes Python 1 &amp; Python 2 in middle school
This should work on Python 3.9.2 and PyGame 2.1.2.

## Project Descriptions
NOTE: All of my graphical projects have a `.pyw` format, and all command-line projectts have a `.py` format.
ANOTHER NOTE: All `tsk.py` files are libraries, created by TechSmart. They don't really do much.

### Python 1 (python1/)
#### Small Scripts (python2/small_scripts/)
The "small scripts" were all of the short, one-off scripts I wrote in my class. In python 1, this includes:
- `acid.pyw`: a weird, psychedelic-looking simulation. the name should explain it pretty well.
- `bean-car.pyw`: drive a bean-car with semi-realistic physics!
- `coolness_test.py`: a quiz that determines if you are "cool"
- `crasher.py`: just a little bit of recursion, what could possibly go wrong?
- `cursed_soup.py`: generates a recipe for a "cursed soup"
- `madlib.py`: a really weird madlib about physics
- `pet_polygon.pyw`: It's my pet polygon!! Isn't it cute?

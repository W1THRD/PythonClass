# PythonClass
Projects I made when I took the classes Python 1 &amp; Python 2 in middle school
This should work on Python 3.9.2 and PyGame 2.1.2.

## Project Descriptions
NOTE: All of my graphical projects have a `.pyw` format, and all command-line projectts have a `.py` format.
ANOTHER NOTE: All `tsk.py` files are libraries, created by TechSmart. They don't really do much.

### Python 1 (python1/)

#### Small Scripts (python1/small_scripts/)
The "small scripts" were all of the short, one-off scripts I wrote in my class. In python 1, this includes:
- `acid.pyw`: a weird, psychedelic-looking simulation. the name should explain it pretty well.
- `bean-car.pyw`: drive a bean-car with semi-realistic physics! use the arrow keys to control the car
- `coolness_test.py`: a quiz that determines if you are "cool"
- `crasher.py`: just a little bit of recursion, what could possibly go wrong?
- `cursed_soup.py`: generates a recipe for a "cursed soup"
- `madlib.py`: a really weird madlib about physics
- `pet_polygon.pyw`: It's my pet polygon!! Isn't it cute?

#### pewpewpew (python1/pewpewpew/)
This game was born when I jokingly stated in class, "I'm gonna make the next big FPS game!"
And so I actually did it.
Run `pewpewpew.py` to get the game started.
Your goal is to shoot as many brown squares as possible before you die.
Click to shoot, and click on ammo boxes to reload (they spawn randomly)

#### Fighting Squares (python1/fighting_squares/)
I'll add a description later

#### Enemies (python1/enemies/)
I'll add a description later

### Python 2 (python2/)
I'll add this later

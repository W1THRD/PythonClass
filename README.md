# PythonClass
Projects I made when I took the classes Python 1 &amp; Python 2 in middle school
This should work on Python 3.9.2 and PyGame 2.1.2.

## Project Descriptions
NOTE: All of my graphical projects have a `.pyw` format, and all command-line projectts have a `.py` format.
ANOTHER NOTE: All `tsk.py` files are libraries, created by [TechSmart](https://www.techsmart.codes/). They don't really do much.

### Python 1 (python1/)

#### Small Scripts (python1/small_scripts/)
The "small scripts" were all of the short, one-off scripts I wrote in my class. In python 1, this includes:
- `acid.pyw`: a weird, psychedelic-looking simulation. the name should explain it pretty well.
- `bean-car.pyw`: drive a bean-car with semi-realistic physics! use the arrow keys to control the car
- `coolness_test.py`: a quiz that determines if you are "cool"
- `crasher.py`: just a little bit of recursion, what could possibly go wrong?
- `cursed_soup.py`: generates a recipe for a "cursed soup"
- `madlib.py`: a really weird madlib about physics
- `pet_polygon.pyw`: It's my pet polygon!! Isn't it cute?

#### PewPewPew (python1/pewpewpew/)
This game was born when I jokingly stated in class, "I'm gonna make the next big FPS game!"

And so I actually did it.

Run `pewpewpew.py` to get the game started.

Your goal is to shoot as many brown squares as possible before you die.

Click to shoot, and click on ammo boxes to reload (they spawn randomly)

#### Fighting Squares (python1/fighting_squares/)
Sit back and relax- that is, while you watch a loud and chaotic battle between the 2 colors of squares.

Not much else to it. There's also some cool statistics you can look at.

#### Enemies (python1/enemies/)
My final project from my Python 1 class. It underwent tons of changes, but eventually ended up looking like this. 

Use the arrow keys to move, try to collect the coins, and try not to die from the moving red things.


### Python 2 (python2/)

#### More Small Scripts (python2/small_scripts/)
The "small scripts" were all of the short, one-off scripts I wrote in my class. In python 2, this includes:
- `LostInTranslation.py`: A translator for made-up languages. This was following a tutorial for techsmart.
- `Scoreboard.py`: a tool for keeping track of the scores of players in a game. Also from a TechSmart tutorial.
- `unit_converter.py`: a tool that converts between imaginary currencies. I might use this for a Minecraft server in the future.

#### Scream2 (python2/scream2/)
A lobotomy-like experience, created by me and my friend Ky. It uses 199 different sound effects, randomly generated shapes, and a text file full of random words. If you have sensitive ears or epilepsy, this program is NOT for you.

Also, I have no idea why we called it "scream2".

#### Protein Maker (python2/protein_maker/)
A really cool project I made, which combines my knowledge of python dictionaries (learned from a book) and protein translation/transcription (learned from Biolog class- seriously one of the coolest science things I've learned). All you have to do is type in the DNA base pairs you start with (Using A, T, C, and G), and my program will convert them into a set of amino acids, which make up a protein. If you notice any mistakes or glitches in it, please report it in [issues](https://github.com/W1THRD/PythonClass/issues).

#### Platforming (python2/platforming)
I went through the painstakingly annoying progress of coding a buggy physics engine TWICE (the first time I accidentally deleted it), and so we have this. There's still lots of weird collision problems I don't know how to fix, maybe one day I will figure it out. 

Use the left and right arrow keys to move, SPACE to jump.

#### Snow Roller (python2/snow_roller)
My final project I ever made in Python 2. It's a fast-pased infinite-runner game, where you play as a snowball rolling down a hill.

Use the left and right arrow keys to move. Avoid the trees and rocks.

Running into other snowballs makes the snowball bigger, and running into campfires makes it smaller.
